# Analysis of algorithms and data structures
Systematic analysis on the performance of three basic algorithms and data structures: sorting algorithms, binary trees and graphs.

# Sorting algorithms
Inside directory [sorting]() there's the implementation of the sorting algorithms [insertion sort]() and [merge sort](). Their performance have been compared through the class [Test]() for the cases of ordered, partially ordered and unordered lists and reported in [report]().

# Binary trees
Inside directory [btrees]() there's the comparison on the performance of the [binary search trees]() and [red-black trees]() for the cases of insertion, deletion and update. The tests have been made through the class [Test]() and reported in [report]()

# Graphs: research of strongly connected components
Inside directory [scc]() there's the analysis on the number of SCCs that can be found in a graph based on the average number of arcs. The tests have been made through the class [Test]() and reported in [report]().
