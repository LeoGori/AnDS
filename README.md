# Analysis of algorithms and data structures
Systematic analysis on the performance of three basic algorithms and data structures: sorting algorithms, binary trees and graphs.

# Sorting algorithms
Inside directory [sorting](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/tree/main/sorting) there's the implementation of the sorting algorithms [insertion sort](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/sorting/Insertion_Sort.py) and [merge sort](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/sorting/Merge_Sort.py). Their performance have been compared through the class [Test](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/sorting/Test.py) for the cases of ordered, partially ordered and unordered lists and reported in [report](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/sorting/report.pdf).

# Binary trees
Inside directory [btrees](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/tree/main/btrees) there's the comparison on the performance of the [binary search trees](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/btrees/BST.py) and [red-black trees](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/btrees/RBT.py) for the cases of insertion and research of nodes. The tests have been made through the class [Test](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/btrees/Test.py) and reported in [report](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/btrees/report.pdf)

# Graphs: research of strongly connected components
Inside directory [scc](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/tree/main/scc) there's the analysis on the number of SCCs that can be found in a graph based on the average number of arcs. The tests have been made through the class [Test](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/scc/Test.py) and reported in [report](https://github.com/LeoGori/AnDS/blob/main/scc/report.pdf).
